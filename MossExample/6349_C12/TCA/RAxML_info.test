RAxML IC and TC score Computation: Computing IC and TC scores induced by trees in file ForTCA.boottrees w.r.t. tree in file ForTCA.treefile


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-AVX -f i -m GTRCAT -t ForTCA.treefile -z ForTCA.boottrees -n test 




Found 1 tree in File ForTCA.treefile



Found 100 trees in File ForTCA.boottrees

All trees in tree set have the same size, executing standard IC/TC algorithm ... 


Found 1 tree in File ForTCA.treefile

Tree certainty for this tree: 33.341241
Relative tree certainty for this tree: 0.340217

Tree certainty including all conflicting bipartitions (TCA) for this tree: 34.947959
